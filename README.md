# Goal
Your goal for this exercise is to create your project using plain Django and implement the features of a Book list API project using DRF.

## Objectives
    * Practice creating a Django model for a database table
    * Create a function-based view
    * Run the server to display the output of your APIs
    * Use GET and POST methods to update a database table built from the model

## Scenario
You've been hired by the manager of a bookshop to create a website and mobile application to streamline the management of their books. The manager should be able to add books on both the app and the website. And the manager and visitors should be able to browse the available selection of books and search for a specific book. So, for this project, you will develop the necessary APIs to support these features.
